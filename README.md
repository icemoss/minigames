# Minigames

## Summary

In this repository is the Chess minigame for the browser. It is created entirely from scratch without any frameworks or external libraries.

## How to Play

Visit https://icemoss.github.io/minigames/chess/index.html in a web browser. Then, click on a piece to select, and click on a valid position to move. White always moves first.

If you wish to not play against the default AI bot, select the Two Player Mode checkbox. This lets you control both colours of pieces so you can play locally with a friend.

## Features

The fully implemented rules of chess, capturing all the edge cases that many online simulators fail to encapsulate. Key examples include:

- Castling
- En Passant
- Draw by Repetition
- 50 Move Rule

In addition, this project also features a custom built chess AI for you to play against. The AI will not fall for simple tricks in the same way other ones may if they are using a simple approach without neural networks.

If you do not wish to play against the AI, you can opt to play against another human using pass and play.

## Deployment

This is a static website, so all that is required is to upload the HTML, CSS, and JS files to any static site host, or alternatively fork this repository and use GitHub Pages.
